# FireEmblemBlazingSword
This project **main idea** is to show i'm capable of creating most of the logic behind this game using the sprites that can be found here: https://www.spriters-resource.com/game_boy_advance/fireemblemtheblazingblade/

Now the idea is to refactor mostly Cursor script which has more information than it should. Split it into different classes to make it semantically more understandable.

**To install** or start working with it just open the whole project with Unity. 

**Controls** **WASD** for move everything, **Enter** for accepting and **Right Shift** for decline.

**Resolution** it should be 3:2 as it was desing but unity seems to not allow builds show up in this resolution so use 640x400.

This project has been done with the **Unity version** 2017.2.0f3 although it shouldn't matter to much if you open it with other versions.
